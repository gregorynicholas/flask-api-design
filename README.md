flask-api-design
================


### what this is:

i'm attempting to use github as a platform for research on code libraries that
implement some form of design around a framework for rest + flask + python, both
client's and providers.


### why:

put very nicely from [jacob](https://github.com/jacobb/nap):
> accessing APIs open-endily is an easy affair. pip install requests, pass in
your data get data back. But the slight differences and demands of different
API creating code thatâ€™s structured, re-usable and simple proves difficult.


### goals:

browsing the code from these libraries, i'm sure you'll find, just like i have,
not just a 80/20 rule, but closer to a 95/5 rule where the authors are
overlapping 95% of code with 5% unique implementation code.

**this overlap + duplication with the most minute difference causes a metric fuck-ton of suck.**

so i'm hoping that this research repository is forked, contributed to by both
users and authors to learn, discuss, and provide relevant knowledge on
experience + design decisions to help formulate collaborative mindshare around
this topic.
